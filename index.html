                Designed, built and piloted a custom pod racer. 32 BBY Boonta Eve Classic Race Champion

                In my spare time at Waldâs Parts junk shop I designed and built a Class III open
                cockpit Podracer capable of 588 mph top speed. Went on to win the Boonta Eve
                Classic race in 32 BBY - first ever win by a human. Generated documented company
                revenue of over 59 wupiupi during the course of my enslavement.
